# StandAlone-database
Work for school on a standalone database for android.

## Update 23/SEP/2017:
Added the Database Manager and the Database Tool, along with the access database. The database has been initialized with the AddTask function inside the DatabaseManager class in order to add a task.
Check AddTask for the two different variants of the addition of the task into the database.
Only work was done inside the DatabaseManager class. Review class in case of errors.

## Update 25/SEP/2017:
Began adding tasks, deleting tasks and showing all tasks that are in the database. Added an inner class inside the DatabaseManager named DatabaseTool. Code is 95% finished.
